## Disorder Prevalence
There is an increase in diagnoses of mental disorders such as depression, autism and ADHD. This project gives an overview of disorder prevalence over the world and might help to get a better understanding in the causes and maintaining factors of mental disorders.

The map gives an insight in the prevalence of disorders in different countries, the bar chart shows the changes over time for specific countries and the parallel coordinates shows the comorbidity between disorders.

It is possible to choose different countries, disorders and years, either by clicking on the map or bar chart or by choosing an option from the dropdown menu.
