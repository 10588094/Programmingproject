        <h3>Disorder Prevalence</h3>
        <p>There's an increase in diagnoses of mental disorders such as depression,
            autism and ADHD. Often treatments are not sufficient due to a lack
            of understanding of what these disorders really are. To prevent/treat a disorder
            it's essential to understand the disorder. An overview of the prevalence of
            disorders over the world can help in getting a better understanding and finding
            possible causes for the increase in diagnoses.
        </p>
        <h3>DALY score</h3>
        <p>The prevalence of disorders is measured with a DALY score. One DALY can
            be thought of as one lost year of "healthy" life. The sum of these DALYs
            across the population, or the burden of disease, can be thought of as a
            measurement of the gap between current health status and an ideal health
            situation where the entire population lives to an advanced age, free of
            disease and disability. To read more about the DALY score
